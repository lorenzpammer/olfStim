function smell = calculateMfcFlowRates(trialNum, smell)
% calculateMfcFlowRates(trialNum, smell) calculates the flow rate for the two mass
% flow controllers, given the desired final concentration of odorant and
% the desired total rate of flow. The function updates the global smell structure.
%
% To do: 
% Fix error handling: if desired concentration cannot be reached because 
% the Nitrogen mfc only has a limited range, give an error and return
% without triggering the trial.
