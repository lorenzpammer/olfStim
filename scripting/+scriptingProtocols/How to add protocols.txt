For every new protocol you want to add, do the following:
1. Create a new folder in +scriptingProtocols and name it starting with a ‘+’ followed by the title of your protocol. Ie if your stimulation protocol is called “fineFragrance” add a folder called “+fineFragrance” 
2. In this newly created folder add a matlab function with the name of your protocol. Following the example above the function would be called “fineFragrance.m” 

In every protocol define the trial number with the variable trialNum. First trial = 1.

In every new trial you have to call buildSmell either updating the entire smell structure (buildSmell(’update’,vars)) or defined fields (buildSmell(‘updateFields’,vars)). This will update the smell structure.

Have a look at one of the existing scripting protocols such as ‘randomOdorPresentation’ or ‘presentPredefinedOdorList’.
