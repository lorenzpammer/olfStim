LASOM Digital Mask assignments

see LASOM_Leaf.txt
see LASOM_XLogic.txt

Selected digital input signals on the LASOM control board are sampled into a 16-bit mask using the
Master FPGA GEN_STATUS register.

Selected digital output signals on the LASOM control board are driven from a 16-bit mask using the
Master FPGA GEN_CONTROL register.

The bit assignments relating the bit mapped registers to signals defined on the connectors are:

Digital Inputs

Bit	Assignment
0	Exp Bus Strobe
1	Strobe In
2	Beam 1
3	Beam 2

4	Beam 3
5	DigIn 1
6	DigIn 2
7	DigIn 3

8	XLogic 1
9	XLogic 2
10	XLogic 3
11	XLogic 4

12	Reserved
13	Reserved
14	Reserved
15	Reserved


Digital Outputs

Bit	Assignment
0	Reserved
1	Reserved
2	Cue 1
3	Cue 2

4	Cue 3
5	DigOut 1
6	DigOut 2
7	DigOut 3

8	XLogic 5
9	XLogic 6
10	XLogic 7
11	XLogic 8

LoadBoard provides test access to these registers via the Test Inst button.

Click Get General Status to read the GEN_STATUS register.
The log window will show "Response: xxxx" where xxxx is the register bit mask reading in hex.
(The first click will show "Response: 103F". Ignore this.)

To test the digital outputs, fill in a hex mask value next to Set Controls, then click it.

To use the Strobe functions, fill in a mask value next to Set Strobes, then click it.

The Strobe mask bit assignments are:

Bit	Assignment
0	Enable Strobe In (J34), to drive Exp Bus strobe line.
1	Enable Strobe Out (J35), to be driven from Exp Bus strobe line (if SOSSC=0).
2	Host Strobe, forces assertion of Exp Bus strobe line.
3	Master Select, (not a strobe function, used in slave topology determination)
7..4	SOSSC - Strobe Out source select code, bit 7 is MSB
	0x0 = Exp Bus Strobe to Strobe Out (default, requires bit 1 set)
	0x1 = Beam 1
	0x2 = Beam 2
	0x3 = Beam 3
	0x4 = DigIn 1
	0x5 = DigIn 2
	0x6 = DigIn 3
	0x7 = XLogic 1
	0x8 = XLogic 2
	0x9 = XLogic 3
	0xA = XLogic 4
	0xB = XLogic 5
	0xC = XLogic 6
	0xD = XLogic 7
	0xE = XLogic 8
	0xF = Strobe In


Note that by writing Strobe mask bit 3 (Host Strobe), by writing the value 4,
that bit 0 of the GEN_STATUS register will be asserted. (The mask will contain 1).

Some examples:

Drive Strobe Out from software:
mask = 6 =>
	bit 0 clear	Strobe In ignored
	bit 1 set	Qualified Exp Strobe enabled to drive first Strobe Out multiplexor input
	bit 2 set	Exp Strobe forced on by Software Strobe
	SOSSC = 0	Strobe Out multiplexor selects Qualified Exp Strobe

Drive Strobe Out from Beam 3:
mask = 48 =>
	bit 0 clear	Strobe In ignored
	bit 1 clear	Qualified Exp Strobe disabled
	bit 2 clear	Exp Strobe disabled
	SOSSC = 3	Strobe Out multiplexor selects Beam 3

Special Logic Version 1:
JAM File: gbx_Special1.jam

This version of logic file contains special case Master FPGA logic.

This version disables the 4 XLogic 1..4 inputs and replaces these signals as follows:
XLogic pin 1..3, driven from input state of Beam 1..3.
XLogic Pin 4, driven from output state of Strobe Out.

XLogic Pin 5..8, driven as usual from the Digital Output signals XLogic 5..8.
