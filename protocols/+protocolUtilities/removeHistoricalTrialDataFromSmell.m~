function smell = removeHistoricalTrialDataFromSmell(smell)
% This is important, as there might be data which are continuously written
% to smell during a trial (eg MFC flow rates). If an old smell structure is
% used to instruct olfStim for a new session, this data has to be removed,
% otherwise weird behavior can happen.
